# TerribleHack

This is a project for the TerribleHack Hackathon. It consists of an Elevator, simulated in C++, that picks up riders and drops them off at random floors. Several objects are drawn to represent the floors, buttons, and NPCs.

### Challenges and Improvements

The main challenge was linking the backend simulation with the graphics. To improve this, classes and methods should be better modulated and documented. It would also greatly increase quality to use pre-made images of the objects instead of drawing them from scratch.
